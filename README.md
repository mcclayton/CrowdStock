CrowdStock
==========

A highly social and crowdsourced stock market prediction application.

CrowdStock will allow users of various financial backgrounds, from novices to advanced traders, to make and view speculations on future stock market behavior. CrowdStock will be highly available through a web and mobile interface to enable any user to sign up, create a profile, and begin gaining a personal reputation of correctness in predicting the behavior of specific stocks in the market. Our project will keep track of data and key metrics such as the following: individual userâ€™s track record of predictions, popular stocks and trends, aggregate predictions of stocks over time, leaderboards of users with the most correct predictions, and many more. CrowdStock will make these metrics available with a highly intuitive interface and easily readable charts and graphs. Users with profiles will be able to follow other users to track their forecasts of stock performance.
